## Overview
### Description
Application that assists users in locating restrooms within a set radius and other filters. Filters will include User Rating, LGBTQ Friendly, Single restroom (one room one stall), customers only, and radius. Users will simply need to press a single button on the screen (shaped as a poop icon) which brings up directions to the chosen restroom, as well as other icons of other potential bathrooms.
